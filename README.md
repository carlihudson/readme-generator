  ## Description
   This week's assignment was to create an application with node.js that automatically creates a README.md file for the user in the command line. It saves users a lot of time so they can get a professionally formatted README file without typing everything from scratch. I generated this file using this application, and added some additional content such as line breaks, links, and bullet points into the file itself. 
   
   This project was entirely done in JavaScript.

  ## Installation
  The user must have a source code editor tool, such as VS Code, TextEdit on Mac, or NotePad on Windows. Additionally, the user will need node.js installed. 
  
  Once those tools are installed, hit the “code” button in this repository and copy the link. In your command line, type "git clone" followed by pasting the copied link to clone onto your own local machine. 
  
  Once you're in your project via the code editing software as well as in the command line, use the following CL commands: 
  * “npm init” or “npm init -y” to install the node package manager and your package.json file. 
  * “npm install inquirer@8.2.4” to get the inquirer package from npm. Make sure to add the @8.2.4 to get the correct version.
  
  ## Usage
  This application could be used for any projects for school, work, or just for fun.
  
  To start using this application, simply type “node index.js” into the command line. You will then get the first question. After you answer, press enter and the next question will appear. 
  
  If you don’t have an answer to a question, you can just press enter to skip. The application will return the section as blank, and you can always go back later and add content to the file.
