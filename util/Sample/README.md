  ## Description
  The README Generator is a quick and easy to use application that creates a quality, professional README.md file. The purpose of the application is to save the user some time so they can focus on the rest of their project, and not have to worry about creating this file. All the user has to do is answer the prompts through their command line.

  ## Installation
  The user must have a source code editor tool, such as VS Code, TextEdit on Mac, or NotePad on Windows. Additionally, the user will need node.js installed. Once those tools are installed, hit the “code” button in this repository, copy the link, then type git clone <paste link here> to clone onto your own local machine. Once in your project via the code editing software and through the command line, use command “npm init” or “npm init -y” to install the node package manager. Lastly, use command “npm install inquirer@8.2.4” to get the inquirer package from npm.
  
  ## Usage
  To start using this application, simply type “node index.js” into the command line. You will then get the first question. After you answer, press enter and the next question will appear. If you don’t have an answer to a question, you can just press enter to skip. The application will return the section as blank (you can always go back later and add content to the file). This application could be used for any projects for school, work, or just for fun.

  ## Contributions
  This is a completed and functioning application, so it does not need any additional contributions.

  ## Tests
  Since this is a file generating application, there’s not really any testing that needs to be done as the application is already complete. But if users want to change the prompts, they could go into the index.js file and edit the array of questions. If they want to change the headers, then can go into the generateMarkdown.js file and change the markdown copy at the bottom of the page.
